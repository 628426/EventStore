The binaries found in this directory are not official builds of Npgsql.

They are versions that have been modified slightly (according to the guidance of the Npgsql author) to work around an issue we discovered:
http://pgfoundry.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1010965&group_id=1000140&atid=590

When the bug is fixed, most likely in January 2011, we will update our binaries.
